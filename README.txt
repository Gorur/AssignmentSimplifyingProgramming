Question number: 4

Question title for assignment 2:Consider a share market bazaar where the value of stocks keep going up and down. 
	Write a
program that asks for a company’s name and it’s share’s cost.

Question Title for assignment 3: This application has a new requirement to show the status of the share value
	compared to the previous value. So if the new value is entered and it is greater than the previous value,
	it should write "up". If it is lesser, it sholud write "down", if it is same, it should write "none".
Source code file: asn2_4.c which has the assignment 3 hard coded in the program. The earlier code runs
	in infinite loop and an another file is unable to read more than one line in the .csv file.
	In another file asn2_4.c I tried re-writing the code for assignment 2 from scratch,but then as discussed with
	Mr. Aayush and Ms. Manisha I hard coded the assignment 3.   
Program Execution: gcc asn2_4.c for the assignment 3 and followed by ./a.out.
		   gcc asn2_4.c for re_written assignment 2 followed by ./a.out -f share.csv
